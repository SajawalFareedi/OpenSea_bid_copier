So, the tool should be able to input multiple accounts and monitor the bids (collections bids + items bids). Whenever the given account bids on something, outbid that account by (ONLY) by increasing the bid price a bit.

Before bidding on item or collection, the tool should satisfy the following conditions:

1. The collections should not be in the blacklist which will be given as an input to the tool.
2. If we are already the top bidder then don't bid again.
3. Only increase the bid by 0.0001 ETH.
4. The bid must be placed on the exact trait (for collection offer).
